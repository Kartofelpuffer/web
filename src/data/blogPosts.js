## First: Stay Safe

If your car will not start in a parking lot, neighborhood street, or office garage in Frisco, turn on your hazards and make sure you are in a safe location.

## 1) Check Battery Symptoms

- Dash lights dim or flicker
- Clicking sound when turning the key
- Slow crank before no-start

These signs usually point to battery or connection issues.

## 2) Inspect Battery Terminals

Pop the hood and look for corrosion or loose terminals. Even a healthy battery can fail to crank if terminals are dirty.

## 3) Confirm You Have Fuel

It sounds obvious, but fuel gauge issues happen often. If low, add fuel and retry.

## 4) Try a Jump Start

If jump-start works, the alternator or battery likely needs testing soon.

## 5) Listen for Starter Clues

A single loud click with no crank often indicates starter trouble.

## 6) Scan for Warning Lights

Check engine, battery, and key/security indicators can narrow down the cause.

## 7) Call for Mobile Diagnosis

If the vehicle still won’t start, a mobile mechanic can test battery health, charging output, and starter draw on-site.

## Your Brakes Are a Safety System

Reliable braking matters on busy Texas roads and highways.

## 1) Squeaking or Squealing
Usually a wear indicator warning that pads are nearing end-of-life.

## 2) Grinding Noise
Metal-on-metal contact often means immediate service is needed.

## 3) Pedal Vibration
Can indicate rotor warping from heat cycling.

## 4) Soft or Spongy Pedal
May point to fluid or hydraulic issues.

## 5) Pulling While Braking
Could indicate uneven wear or caliper issues.

**If any of these show up, schedule an inspection quickly to reduce risk and cost.**
